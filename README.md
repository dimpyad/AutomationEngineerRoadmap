# Automation Engineer Roadmap
This roadmap is designed to guide Automation Engineers seeking to expand their skill set. No matter if you're already good or just starting out, this guide will give you the tools and knowledge you need to stay ahead in world of automation.

<details>
<summary>Foundational Pillars
</summary>
  
### Programming Basics:
- Master a language like Java, Python or JavaScript (depending on your existing skills and target domain).
- Learn fundamental programming constructs like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Practise basic algorithms and data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, arrays, linked lists, sorting, searching etc).
- Understand error handling and debugging techniques.
- Get familiar with version control concepts (e.g. Git).

### OOP Concepts:
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Learn how to design and implement classes, objects, and methods effectively.
- Understand relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition).
- Apply good class design principles for maintainability.
- Grasp object relationships and interactions (message passing, method calls).

<summary>Deep Dive into Advanced Programming Concepts
</summary>

### Programming Advanced Concepts:
- Explore advanced features of your chosen language (e.g., Java 8 streams, Python decorators).
- Learn functional programming concepts.
- Gain understanding of concurrency options, For example: multithreading for utilizing multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing for parallel processing across multiple physical cores and asynchronous programming for non-blocking I/O and event-driven workflows.
- Deepen your knowledge of error handling. Example: Utilize custom exceptions for clear and specific error categorization. Leverage exception chaining for propagating context and simplifying debugging. Implement best practices for robust error handling to ensure program resilience.

### Design Patterns:
- Understand why do we need to understand few common design patterns.
- Page Object model and pros/cons of the same.
- Factory method design pattern enabling flexibility in test setup and teardown.
- Data provider for supporting data driven testing
- Fluent Interface for enhancing test readability and maintainability by enabling method chaining.
- Decorator pattern for dynamically adds or modifies behavior of test objects without affecting their core functionality.
- Singleton pattern useful for managing shared resources or test configurations.
- Adapter pattern for facilitate testing with external systems or legacy code by adapting incompatible interfaces.
- Observer pattern can be used for implementing notification mechanisms or test reporting.


### Clean Code Practices:
- Learn principles of clean code like readability, maintainability, modularity, and documentation.
- Practice code formatting, consistent naming conventions, and error handling.

<summary>Understanding Unit Testing
</summary>

### Unit Testing Concepts and Frameworks:
- Understand the importance of unit testing and its role in automating test cases.
- Learn a unit testing framework like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or TestNg (Java).
- Write unit tests for your code at the function/method level.

### Mocking Concepts and Frameworks:
- Understand the concept of mocking and its benefits for unit testing.
- Learn a mocking framework like WireMock (API mocking) or Mockito (object mocking).
- Use mocks to isolate dependencies and improve test stability.

### Project 3

<summary>Advanced Automation Techniques & Tools
</summary>

### Contract Testing:
- Learn contract-driven development (CDD) principles and tools like Pact or Pactflow.
- Define API contracts to ensure compatibility between producers and consumers.

### Config Management:
- Understand the importance of configuration management for automation projects.
- Learn tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Puppet to manage and automate infrastructure configurations.

### Test Data Management:
- Learn strategies for managing test data effectively (e.g., data generators, mocks, fixtures).
- Explore tools like Faker or Mockaroo for generating realistic test data.

### Test Execution Reporting:
- Understand the importance of test reporting for analyzing results and making informed decisions.
- Learn how to  generate comprehensive test reports.

### Test Containers:
- Learn how to use Docker containers to run tests in isolated and reproducible environments.
- Explore tools like Testcontainers to simplify container management for testing.
- Property Driven Testing Tools:

### Understand the concept of property-based testing (PBT) and its benefits.
- Mutation Testing Tools:
- Learn the concept of mutation testing and its role in assessing test suite quality.
- Explore tools like PITest or Stryker to introduce artificial faults into code and evaluate test effectiveness.
### Threading Concepts for Parallel Test Execution:
- Understand the benefits of parallel test execution for faster feedback cycles.
- Learn threading concepts in your chosen language (e.g., Java threads, Python's multiprocessing module).
- Explore libraries or frameworks that simplify parallel test execution (e.g., JUnit ParallelRunner, TestNG parallel execution).

### Project 4

<summary>Important Points  to Remember:
</summary>

### Practice Consistently
  - Dedicate at least 1 hour daily to practising and learning new skills. Consistency is key to progress.

### Plan & Review: 
  - Create a 3-month plan with specific goals and review it monthly to adapt and adjust your roadmap as needed.

### Stay Updated: 
  - The field of test automation is constantly evolving. Stay updated with the latest trends and technologies through blogs, conferences, and online communities.

### Network & Collaborate: 
  - Connect with other automation engineers, participate in online forums and discussions, and learn from each other's experiences.
