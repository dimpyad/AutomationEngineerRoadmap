  ### Quiz Application:  
  #### Features:
    - Create a variety of question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer).
    - Implement different difficulty levels.
    - Track user scores and progress.
    - Store and retrieve quiz data   
  #### Hint
    - Model questions, answers, and user scores using classes.
    - Use inheritance to create different question types.
    - Implement methods for handling user input, checking answers, and calculating scores.

  ### Personal Finance Tracker:  
  #### Features:
    - Track income, expenses, and account balances.
    - Create budgets and categorize transactions.
    - Generate reports on spending habits and financial progress.
  #### Hint
    - Model accounts, transactions, and categories as classes.
    - Use methods for calculating balances, generating reports, and visualizing financial data.

  ### Restaurant Menu Management System:  
  #### Features:
    - Add, edit, and delete menu items. 
    - Categorise dishes
    - Calculate bills
    - Print orders.

  #### Hint
    - Create a "MenuItem" class with constructors for different dish types (drinks, appetisers, main courses).
    - Use static methods for common tasks like printing the entire menu or calculating total bill.
    - Implement inner classes for order details and customer information.
    - Apply generics to handle different data types for menu items and order specifics.
    - Develop a user interface (e.g., console or GUI) for managing the menu and handling orders.

<summary>Deep Dive into Advanced Programming Concepts
</summary>

### Programming Advanced Concepts:
- Explore advanced features of your chosen language (e.g., Java 8 streams, Python decorators).
- Learn functional programming concepts.
- Gain understanding of concurrency concepts.
- Deepen your knowledge of error handling. Example: Utilize custom exceptions for clear and specific error categorization.
- Leverage exception chaining for propagating context and simplifying debugging. 

### Clean Code Practices:
- Readability: Write code that's easy to understand for both you and others.
- Maintainability: Structure code for easy modification and bug fixing.
- Modularity: Break down code into well-defined, reusable components.
- Documentation: Provide clear explanations of code functionality and intent.
- Descriptive Naming: Use meaningful variable, function, and class names.
- Meaningful Comments: Explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
- Consistent Formatting: Adhere to a consistent code style guide for indentation, spacing, and newlines.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error checking and handling mechanisms.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before code to ensure quality and guide design.
- Refactoring: Regularly improve code structure without changing its external behavior.
- Code Reviews: Involve peers in reviewing code to catch issues and share knowledge.

### Project 2

<summary>Unit testing and design patters
</summary>

### Unit Testing Concepts and Frameworks:
  - Understand the importance of unit testing and its role in automating test cases.
  - Introduction to Test Automation Pyramid
  - Start with any unit testing framework basics(Junit/TestNG/Pytest/NUnit etc)
  - Learn about test organization patterns (hooks/fixtures) 
  - Learn about the  core compomnet of the unit test framework (Annotiations, Parameters, Dependencies, Factories, Listeners, Dependency injection etc as applicable.)
  - Creating Layered architecture (clear segrigation between business logic/application logic/data/utils)
  - Handling test data effectively from internal or external data sources.
  - Handling configations in the framework
  - Creating useful test reports
  - Creating reusable utlilities
  - Execution patterns (sequencial/parallel)

### Test execution
  - Run test on local machine
  - Understanding more on test setup creation.
  - Run test on docker container in local machine
  - Run test on CI (example: github action)
  - Run test on dedicated setup in cloud (example:EC2)

<details>
<summary>Project 3 - Test Data Management System
</summary>

  ### Core Functionalities:
  #### Database Interactions:
    - Use JDBC to connect to your chosen database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
    - Create Java classes to represent test data entities and map them to database tables.
    - Implement methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on test data.
  #### Mock Data Generation:
    - Use libraries like Apache Commons Lang for random data generation.
    - Create custom logic for generating realistic data based on specific data types and formats.
  #### Data Anonymization:
    - Develop algorithms for masking or obfuscating sensitive information (e.g., names, addresses).
    - Consider using libraries like Apache OpenBLAS for more advanced anonymization techniques.
  #### Import/Export:
    - Use Java's file I/O capabilities to read and write test data from/to files (CSV, JSON, XML).
    - Implement parsing and formatting logic for different data formats.
  #### User Interface:
    - Create a menu-driven console application using Java's Scanner class for user input.
    - Display options for managing test data, generating data, searching, importing/exporting, etc.
  #### Test Framework Integration:
    - Write unit tests to ensure the TDMP's functionalities work as expected.
    - Create test cases for database interactions, data generation, anonymization, and other features.
